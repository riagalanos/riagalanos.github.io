I am the software engineering lead for learning and development at Yext, a tech company focused on online brand management.  I am based out of Northern Virginia.  

Prior to becoming a software engineer, I had been in the classroom for 18 years - 16 of those as a computer science teacher.  I am passionate about introducing young people to the field of computer science, teaching them how to program, showing them how to create something from nothing, and making them thirsty to learn more.  I enjoy collaborating with and mentoring other teachers in order to improve student achievement.

I am interested in finding ways to increase: the number of students who take computer science courses at the middle and high school levels, the percentage of girls and under-represented minorities in those courses, and the number of students who pursue further study in the field.

In addition to working at Yext, I continue to serve as a consultant with the College Board, leading workshops for AP Computer Science A teachers.

I often get asked to speak to teachers.  My current passion is making assignments for students that use real-world data as a way of motivating and keeping them interested in their work.

Had a soundbite once on NPR.  Still can't get over that it involved cats.

I retired from coaching cheerleading in 2011.  I now use my pom poms to cheer for CS.
