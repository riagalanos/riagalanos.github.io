Tomorrow begins a new chapter in my life.  Chapter eight if you count pre-college in Hollywood, FL, college at RPI, a short time in Tucson, AZ post-graduation, AAAS, my work as a defense contractor at the Pentagon, my first teaching gig at Centennial HS in suburban Atlanta, and my second teaching gig at TJHSST as the first seven..

*Software engineer.*  I can hardly believe it.  I’ve been preparing students for this career for the past 16 years.  It’s not that I didn’t think I could pursue this role before, I just loved teaching that much.  I still want to work with young people, but now I hope to work with them from the industry side.  Please hold me accountable.

*Software engineer.*  Friends, family, and teaching colleagues have been asking me what I’ll be doing.  I’ve had to tell them that other than working for Yext, I have no idea in the short term.  Don’t know what team I’ll be working on, which languages or frameworks I’ll be using, or what tools I will need to learn how to use.  Eeek!  Long term, I’m tasked with leading the engineering side’s learning and development program.  They think I have skills in this area.

*Software engineer.*  I’m excited!  Filled with anticipation.  Can’t really say I’m nervous, although tomorrow’s report on hours of sleep will expose that truth.  Who will be my nearest desk partners?   Will I get to work with any other women?  Will the office be freezing?  What are they serving for lunch?  Will my chair be comfortable?  Will I receive a warm welcome?  Will I be brave enough to ask all the questions I want answers to?  When will imposter syndrome set in?

I’m ready.  Filled out my W-4 and I-9 paperwork.  Check.  Have my passport and a voided check in hand to bring to my benefits meeting tomorrow.  Check.  Picked out my medical plan and decided on the percentage I want to contribute to my retirement plan.  Check.  And I have decided on what to wear.  Check.  As a #womanintech, I was going to worry about this a little, but then I realized that my casual is usually a little better than the industry norm of t-shirts and jeans.  So I’m safe (I think.) 

Time for a good night’s sleep.  Haha.
