I have been a member of the AP Computer Science A community since 2003. I taught the course from 2003-2019, served as a Reader/Table Leader/Question Leader for the APCS A exam from 2007-2019, and was a member of the test development committee from 2017-2019.  I started delivering one-day and multi-day workshops for the College Board in 2014 and I plan to continue in that role.   

Although I have left the classroom and am now working as a software engineer, I will remain involved in the community.  I enjoy answering questions about the course and the material, love sharing ideas and items I've made, and am always happy to talk about my favorite way to motivate and keep students engaged:  using real-world data in programming assignments.
